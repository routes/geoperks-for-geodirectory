GeoPerks is Special Sauce for GeoDirectory. 

== Description ==

GeoPerks is Special Sauce for GeoDirectory

This plugin works with GeoDirectory V2+ to add special features not included with GeoDirectory.

Options - 

GeoPerk Featured First for "Search For" results - enable this perk to make featured listings returned in search results 'rise to the top' automatically.

GeoPerk GD Shortcode button for Gutenberg Classic Editor block - sometimes you just want to use a shortcode in a block. Turn on this perk to add a GDV2 shortcode builder button to the Gutenberg Classic editor block. You shouldn't save shortcodes in classic blocks, but it is the best place to add a button. Instead, copy out the shortcode and add it to a Shortcode or HTML block.
